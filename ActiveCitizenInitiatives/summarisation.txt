01=Citizens call for a Europe-wide carbon quota system where everyone gets a yearly carbon allowance that shrinks over time. It starts with air travel and expands to all goods and services. Companies must label their products’ carbon impact, pushing them to cut emissions. People can trade unused carbon credits locally. An independent agency would manage the system, aiming for fairness, climate action, and public involvement.
02=Europe faces a growing water crisis, with droughts, pollution, and poor efficiency threatening access to clean water. Citizens and experts call for water to become a top EU priority, equal to decarbonisation, through an EU Blue Deal. This means reducing water use, supporting water-efficient technologies, and integrating water concerns into all EU policies. A shift to a "Water-Smart Society" would protect people, jobs, ecosystems, and industry. An independent water strategy is needed to secure long-term resilience and fairness across Europe.
03=The EU should create stronger laws to protect agriculture and rural areas, focusing on food production, fair prices, and better support for farmers. A European Hydrological Plan is needed to ensure clean, reliable water supply across all regions, as current water policies have failed to deliver. Farmers rely on healthy soil and water, but poor infrastructure and pollution threaten food security. The EU must treat water as a shared resource and invest in better systems. Finally, a permanent EU Agency or Committee should represent agriculture and rural interests in all policy decisions
04=HouseEurope! calls for renovation, not demolition, to become the norm across Europe. They demand tax incentives, fair building assessments, and recognition of the CO₂ already stored in existing buildings. The aim is to save resources, reduce emissions, protect communities, and support a fair, local construction economy. The current system encourages wasteful demolition driven by speculation, which harms the environment, heritage, and social fabric. Renovation is key to affordable housing, job creation, and reaching EU climate goals by 2050.
05=The initiative asks the European Commission to promote safe, legal, and fair access to psychedelic-assisted therapies for mental health. It calls for more research, clear care standards, and training for healthcare providers. Psychedelics show promise for tough conditions like PTSD and depression, but EU efforts and policies need to catch up. The EU should support collaboration, update regulations, and create special frameworks to safely integrate these treatments.
06=European consumers need clear, honest food origin info and quality guarantees. All imports must meet EU health, environmental, and labor standards. Labels should show where raw ingredients come from and where products are processed. Border checks on food imports must be stricter to prevent fraud. Origin info must be mandatory on all food, including in restaurants and schools.
07=Factory farming and slaughterhouses violate animal rights and threaten public health by increasing pandemic risks. We call for EU incentives to boost plant-based and cultivated meat production as ethical alternatives. A plan should be made to cut farm animal numbers by 50% each year and gradually close all animal farms. This shift would respect animal welfare laws and reduce health risks like salmonella and antibiotic resistance. Ending factory farming is urgent to protect animals, public health, and prevent future pandemics.
08=This initiative calls for videogame publishers in the EU to keep their games playable for consumers, preventing remote disabling after sales. It does not demand ownership or ongoing support but insists games remain functional without publisher help. Many games today rely on online connections, and when publishers cut these, customers lose access, violating basic consumer rights. This practice destroys creative works and challenges the idea of ownership, as customers effectively lose what they bought. The initiative cites EU laws protecting consumer rights and demands actions that override restrictive license agreements to stop this unfair practice.
